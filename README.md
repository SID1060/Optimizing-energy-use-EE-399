# Optimizing Energy Usage for the IITGN Campus

## Problem Statement
IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN) faces challenges related to high energy consumption and inefficiencies in its current energy use practices. The campus experiences high energy demand, necessitating awareness among students and staff about energy conservation practices.

### Objective
The objective is to optimize energy use at IITGN by implementing sustainable and cost-effective strategies. This includes conducting energy audits to identify areas for improvement, improving building envelopes, increasing the use of renewable energy sources, and promoting behavioral changes to reduce energy consumption. The goal is to reduce energy costs, lower the carbon footprint, improve indoor comfort, and enhance IITGN's reputation as a sustainable campus. The implementation plan involves a phased approach, collaboration with energy experts, and monitoring and evaluation of energy use to assess the effectiveness of the strategies.
